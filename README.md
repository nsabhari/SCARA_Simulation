This project was done as a part of Foundations of Robotics course.<br />

Velocity Kinematics simulation for a scara robot using Gazebo and ROS has been implemented.This has been split into 3 sections :<br />
A : Forward and Inverse Kinematics<br />
B : Implementing PD control for Position Control<br />
C : Velocity Control of SCARA<br />

A report is avaialable for each part explaining the behavior of the modules and the robot for better understanding.
