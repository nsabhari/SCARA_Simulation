This project was done as a part of Foundations of Robotics course.

Velocity Kinematics simulation for a scara robot using Gazebo and ROS has been implemented. This has been split into 3 sections :
A : Forward and Inverse Kinematics
B : Implementing PD control for Position Control
C : Velocity Control of SCARA

A report is avaialable for each part explaining the behavior of the modules and the robot for better understanding.
